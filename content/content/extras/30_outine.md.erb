##### Week 2: How do robots know what to do?
* Content:
   * Autonomous robot behaviors are mechanisms constructed from carefully designed algorithms and representations.
   * What's an operating system?
   * Robot behavior is inherrently concurrent and the code therefore his highly concurrent
   * Requires the use of some kind of distributed operating system
