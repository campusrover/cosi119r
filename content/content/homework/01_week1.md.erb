## 1. Reading PRR - Chapters 1,2,3

### Purpose 

We will follow along the reading of the textbook pretty closely and in so learn all about how ROS works. The warmup questions will help guide your reading and experimenting.

### What you will learn

* What a topic is
* What a Node is
* What Odometry is
* What a distributed operating system is

### Tasks

* Read PRR Chapters 1, 2 and 3
* It's important that you use these chapter notes to add detail and make some corrections:
    * <%= link_to_topic :ros_intro %>
    * <%= link_to_topic :ros_fundamentals %>
    * <%= link_to_topic :ros_topics %>
* As you read, you will find the code for the examples all in the prrexamples package. It is very important that you try to run some of them to get a feel for it.
* Try to run them to get a feel for it.
* After doing this please answer the following warmup questions:
    * It is said that ROS nodes communicate peer to peer. What does this mean?
    * If a ROS node is running on a robot and another one is running on my laptop, how do they even talk to each other?
    * In what way is a robot `pose` different from its `position`?
    * What one or two things are you still totally confused about in this reading? If its all clear, then what are your biggest takeaways from this reading?
