## 1. Do part 2 of ROS PA3: Ros Roomba
* Implement part 2 of <%= link_to_topic :ros_roomba %> 
* <%= deliverable "See the homework specification for your deliverables." %>

## 2. ROS PA 4: Teach a Robot to Dance
* Please read the instructions and deliverables closely for this assignment: <%= link_to_topic :teleop_plus %>

## 3. Read this seminal paper in Robotics
### Purpose
* Reading seminal papers in Robotics provides a great and broader view of robotics beyond engineering.
* In general practicing how to read academic papers helps you find and read the best ones

### Activities
* Read [Brooks - Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-robust-layered-control-system-for-a-mobile-robot-Brooks/dc66c15a005dd1a3a9f033769e7fbc3b943be188).
* Highlight parts that are especially interesting or difficult to understand. 
* Consider how this approach might have been used in a more advanced version of your Roomba script.
* <%= deliverable "What is important in this paper for you? What is the key message? Can you make a connection between it and your roomba algorithm? Think about a maze solving robot or a wall following robot. Are there any ways in which this paper might apply?" %>
