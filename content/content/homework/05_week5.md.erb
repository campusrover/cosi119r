## 1. Wall Following Paper <%= partbadge %>
*(1 hour)*

### Purpose
* Practice reading academic papers
* Start seeing the subtlety of making robot do what is a trivial thing for a person to do

### Steps
* Read: [Wall Following Algorithms Paper](https://github.com/ssscassio/ros-wall-follower-2-wheeled-robot/blob/master/report/Wall-following-algorithm-for-reactive%20autonomous-mobile-robot-with-laser-scanner-sensor.pdf). Write up what your major takeaways are from this paper.

* <%= deliverable "1 page max pdf writeup" %>

## 2. LIDAR - Use your intuition!
*(0.5 hours)*

I want you to use your intuition and your knowledge of geometry. Try to understand the data that comes from the LIDAR. You can think of them as "rays" that go in all directions. The data you get back is an array of distances to the first obstacle. Using words, diagrams and/or pseudo code, try and answer:

  * Given a single LIDAR sensor how would you detect that you are about the crash into a wall?
  * How would you compute the angle at which you are approaching the wall?
  * <%= deliverable "Submit your response as a pdf. Points off for a superficial answer." %>
