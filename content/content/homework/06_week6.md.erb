## 1. Read Chapter 9 of PRR

* As usual, read and do the examples in Chapter 9. The chapter supplement can be found here: <%= link_to_topic :building_maps %>. <%= deliverable "Respond to the questions, and submit in a pdf" %> Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?
