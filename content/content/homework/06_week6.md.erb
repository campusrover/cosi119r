## 1. Read Chapter 9 of PRR <%= partbadge %>

* As usual, read and do the examples in Chapter 9. The chapter supplement can be found here: <%= link_to_topic :building_maps %>
* <%= deliverable "Respond to the questions, and submit in a pdf" %> Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?

## 2. Read (and actually code up) the examples in the [TF2 Tutorials Sequence](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials). <%= partbadge %>

There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:

1. What is the TF tree? Where is it stored? (that may be a trick question!)
1. In your own words, how does turtle_tf2_demo work?
1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.

<%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>


## 3. Learn about Degrees of Freedom

* The concept of DoF is intuitive, to an extent. A ground vehicle cannot move in the Z-direction and a differential drive robot can't move sideways. 
* For valuable context of the full depth of the concept. watch this:

<%= deliverable "NONE"%>

## 4. ROS PA 6: Following walls - not as easy as you think!
