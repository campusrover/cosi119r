## 1. Read Chapter 9 of PRR

* As usual, read and do the examples in Chapter 9. The chapter supplement can be found here: <%= link_to_topic :building_maps %>. <%= deliverable "Respond to the questions, and submit in a pdf" %> Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?


## 2. Learn about Degrees of Freedom

* The concept of DoF is intuitive, to an extent. A ground vehicle cannot move in the Z-direction and a differential drive robot can't move sideways. 
* For valuable context of the full depth of the concept. watch this:

## 3. ROS PA 6: Following walls - not as easy as you think!
* Please read the instructions and deliverables closely for this assignment: <%= link_to_topic :teleop_plus %>
