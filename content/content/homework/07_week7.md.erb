:h2 Read (and actually code up) the examples in the [TF2 Tutorials Sequence](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials). <%= partbadge %>

There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:

1. What is the TF tree? Where is it stored? (that may be a trick question!)
1. In your own words, how does turtle_tf2_demo work?
1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.

:deliverable Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top.
