## 1. Assignment 1

1. <%= zipbadge %> Do <%= link_to_topic :hw_tf2 %>. Follow the instructions and submit the requested deliverables.


### Purpose

1. **Programming: Maze** Please do <%= link_to_topic :hw_ros_maze %>. Note that this is a pair assignment, which means that you should work together with someone and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually really collaborate. And that both people get a good understanding of how things work. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important. 

2.**Read and Do** Read PRR Chapter 10 <%= partbadge %> 

**PLEASE** remember to refer to this (<%= link_to_topic :localization %> in parallel and use the code I provided!). There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:
    1. Why is it important to get a good initial localization? Why is that needed at all? Could AMCL work without it?
    1. This one is a little tricky. When I am using AMCL and move_base, can I use teleop to cause the robot to crash into the wall. Give your reasoning! You might  need to try this to get a good answer. It will be a very interesting experiment.
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.
    <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>
