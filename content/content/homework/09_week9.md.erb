## 1. Read and do PRR Chapter 12  <%= partbadge %>

* Yes we are skipping Chapter 11 for now. Chapter 12 will teach you a few new concepts that will be very helpful in completing the line follower assignment below. Make sure you do this part first! 
* Some of you have just been reading and not "doing" the code examples in the chapters. This is to your detriment. You know I always say that most of the learning only happens when you are hands-on in the code! Also remember to use the chapter supplements that O've provided in <%= link_to_topic :prr_follow_bot %>. With that, answer the following questions about basic robotic perception using Follow Bot:
    1. What is OpenCv exactly? Don't quote Google or the book. In your own words. 3 sentences more or less.
    1. What is a Centroid exactly?  Don't quote Google or the book. In your own words. 3 sentences more or less.
    1. Why is there a red circle drawn on top of the yellow line? What do you expect that circle to do?
    1. <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>

## 2. Assignment Line Follower

* Do <%= link_to_topic :line_follower %>. Follow instructions and submit indicated deliverables

## 3. Term Project Proposals

* As we get to the end of the basic robotics material, I want to explore the option closely of having a final term project. 
* This can be a team project, with 2 or 3 students working together
* It can be done with a physical robot, with simulation and in other ways that I can introduce
* We will be brainstorming in class for ideas
* This assignment is for you to research and writeup two different project ideas.
* The writeup should be 1-2 paragraphs, and include a name and your name plus proposed team mate(s) if any
