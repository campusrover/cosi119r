:slide_title Programming Assignments

* We have a collection of programming assignments
* This list is just for your reference
* They have a twofold purpose
    * Give students a programming challenge based on what they have learned so far
    * Present a sequence of problems which would have to be solved for Campus Rover
    * Each assignment builds on the one before it

    :slide_title How PAs work

* Intructions are provided and they are detailed
* Code submission
    * I expect that you will try and use LLM to get going
    * You will submit your source code with your comments
    * I expect that you will have written all that yourself
* Video submssion
    * You will also submit a video explanation of your work
    * It has to be in your voice and  your words
    * You should demnonstrate the result
    * And explain key parts of the code in your words.
    * Length of the video should be up to around 3 minutes
    * It must include both a video of your submission running (IRL or in sim as the case may be), as well as a tour of some key parts of the code.
