### Programming Assignments

* We have a collection of programming assignments
* This list is just for your reference
* **NOT ALL WILL BE ASSIGNED EACH YEAR!**
* They have a twofold purpose
    * Give students a programming challenge based on what they've learned so far
    * Present a sequence of problems which would have to be solved for Campus Rover
    * Each assignment builds on the one before it

:slide_title How PAs work
* Intructions are provided and they are detailed
* Code submission
    * I expect that you will try and use LLM to get going
    * You will submit your source code with your comments
