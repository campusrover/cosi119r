title: Programming Assignments

## Background

* The overarching project objective for our lab is to build the <%= link_to_topic :campus_rover %>. 
* Over the last year or two we've made progress towards it 
* It is a very difficult and really as yet unsolved, research question. 

### Programming Assignments

* We have a sequence of 6 programming assignments
* They have a twofold purpose
    * Give students a programming challenge based on what they've learned so far
    * Present a sequence of problems which would have to be solved for Campus Rover
* Each assignment builds on the one before it
