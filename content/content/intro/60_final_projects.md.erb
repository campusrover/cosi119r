## Projects

* Each team submits a project proposal for their project: <%= link_to_topic :hw_119a_term_project_proposal %>
* During the final 4-5 weeks of the course, working on the project will be the *only homework* (almost)
* Given more than one person on the team, and the time, we have pretty high expectations for an interesting project
* Pito and the TAs will be constantly available for help and advice

## Deliverables for the term project are:

1. Complete, high quality source code
    * As packages
    * With an appropriate readme.md
 * Adhering to reasonable professional design, structure, documentation etc.
1. Video demonstration
  * 3 to 5 minutes max
  * Quality comparable to if you were doing a live demo for, say, Tim Hickey
  * Show off your results, and explain and/or show the interesting computer science and engineering aspects
1. Project repo including report using GitHub pages
  * All your code and other associated files should be in a github repo inside of the CampusRover organization
  * It should be organized and not have any random left over files
  * It should be presentable as an interview artifact
  * It should include a multi-page project report as github pages 
  * The report should include **TBD**
1. Contribution to Lab Notebook
  * One or more Lab Notebook contributions.
  * Think about a how-to, tutorial, explanation, concept, that you had to figure out yourselves that was difficult to track down and write it up for the next generation of students
  * Here are some examples: [Communicating with Rosserial](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/ros-tips/communicate-with-rosserial), [AWS RoboMaker](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/miscellaneous/aws-robomaker), [Alexa Voice Integration](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/cr-package/voice/voice)

  1. Schedule
    * All deliverables are due on December 4, 2020 at 11:50pm
    * I am considering a zoom open house/demo sometime that week as well. More to come
