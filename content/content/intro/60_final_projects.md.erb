## Term Projects

* Each team submits a project proposal for their project: <%= link_to_topic :hw_119a_term_project_proposal %>
* During the final 4-5 weeks of the course, working on the project will be the *only homework* (almost)
* Given more than one person on the team, and the time, we have pretty high expectations for an interesting project
* Pito and the TAs will be constantly available for help and advice

### Deliverables for the term project are:

#### Contribution to Lab Notebook
* One or more Lab Notebook contributions.
* Think about a how-to, tutorial, explanation, concept, that you had to figure out yourselves that was difficult to track down and write it up for the next generation of students
* Here are some examples: [Communicating with Rosserial](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/ros-tips/communicate-with-rosserial), [AWS RoboMaker](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/miscellaneous/aws-robomaker), [Alexa Voice Integration](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/cr-package/voice/voice)
