### Logging in for the first time

* You will need this to do Monday's homework
* If you have a powerful enough computer we will run it on your computer (Macs are really easy)
* Otherwise we will provide you a cloud environment
* They are 100% equivalent to each other
* Julian will get you set up. We can do it now or later
* I will demo what it looks like for you to see
