<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read** PRR Chapters 5,6 (and then do the work using: <%= link_to_topic :actions %>, <%= link_to_topic :robots_simulators %>). Think about the following *warmup questions* and write your responses to them:
   1. How many degrees of freedom does our TurtleBot3 have and what are they?
   1. If you wanted to have your TurtleBot3 drive one meter forwards and stop, take a guess at what you would publish
   1. What would be an example of a *holonomic* robot or vehicle? Can you say what you think it means?
   1. Please name any concepts, topics or words that you are still confused about, and what your major take-aways are from this reading.
   
   <%= deliverable "Write up your very brief answers to these questions."%>
