:slide_title Review - how it works in ROS (5 minutes)

* All your code (almost) in ROS is a node
* All information (almost) is transferred in the form of messages
* Sensors
  * Are electronic devices
  * Wired to the built in computer
  * In the case of the TB3, wired to the Arduino
  * Code on the Arduino read the i/o and participate as a node in ROS
  * Publishing information
* ROS info required
  * What is the "topic" that the device publishes to
  * How frequently does it publish (e.g. 10 times per second, once every second)
  * And what is the message type
* Acting on the sensor data
  * A node subscribes to that topic
  * Writes a "handler" which is invoked each time the sensor node publishes
* Simulation and IRL are different
  * Sensor's specifications are different (subtly)
  * Ranges and what happens when out of range
  * Degree of "randomness"
  * Exact dimensions of robots, obstacles, etc.

:slide_title Lets look at some code about sensors

* Demonstrate code from [RPSExamples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campusrover/rpsexamples/main/src/outbackstraight2.py?token=AAAK5CK2M32BIJ4SOJKU6EDAH6CK6)
* Demonstrate Laser data quality by [looking at it in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FmGs7XlWe9YGtRFutOiiqSNj7i2DxvQIfJmmn1yMBvw/edit?usp=sharing)
