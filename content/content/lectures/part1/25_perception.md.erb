:slide_title Real Robots Don't Drive Straight - random 2 person breakout - 10 minutes

* What was the "Real Robots Don't Drive Straight" about?
* What is/or are your key takeaways What surprised you?
* In breakout group - please nominate who will report out

:slide_title How do Robots Perceive? Sensors

* What is a sensor? Is a sensor an input or output device?
* What happens to the sensing information
* How is it stored and detected and acted upon?

:slide_title Types of Sensors

* Is a sensor an input or output device?
* Proprioception
* Is a keyboard a sensor?
* Is a joystick a sensor?
* Is a map a sensor?
* Active Vs. Passive
* Sensor Fusion

:slide_title Lidar

* What is a Lidar
* What does it look like and how does it work?
* "Time of travel" detector
* What does the data look like? 
  * [Look here fore the message definition](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html)
  * `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_1.launch`
  * `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch`
  * `rostopic echo --noarr -c /scan`

:slide_title Subtleties

* What do the directions mean?
* Are the directions absolute or relative?
* What if the robot is not pointing to where you think?
* Do they go clockwise or counterclockwise?
* Lets look at the data!
* It's not clean! (This is typical for all sensors)
* It is not accurate!
* It's sometimes wildly inaccurate
* It is constantly flooding in

:slide_title Breakout (15 Minutes)

* Documentation for [LaserScan Data](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html)
* Given
   1. angle_min = 0 # exactly forward
   1. angle_max = 359
   1. range_min = 0.12
   1. range_max = 3.5
* With your teammates write a few lines of python
* Set the variable wall_ahead to true or false

:slide_title Motor (encoder)

* Key characteristics or features
* What data it provides

:slide_title Camera

* How it works
* Key Characteristics or features
* What Data it provides

:slide_title Depth Camera

* How it works
* Key Characteristics or features

:slide_title IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit

* See [Accelerometer, Gyro, IMU buying guide](https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/accel_gyro_guide)
* Acceleration: dynamic and static (as in gravity)
* Gyro: Angular velocity - how fast spinning around an acciss
* Can have them independently or combined into an IMU

:slide_title GPS

* How it works
* Key Characteristics or features
* What data it provides
