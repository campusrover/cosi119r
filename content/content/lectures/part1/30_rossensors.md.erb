## How does a robot perceive

### Logistics

### Discussion
* Lets talk over your answers to the homework questions
* Discussion of the pace of the course so far. Fast? Slow? 
* Show projects area being developed

### Review - how it works in ROS
* All your code (almost) in ROS is a node
* All information (almost) is transferred in the form of messages
* Sensors
  * Are electronic devices
  * Wired to the built in computer
  * In the case of the TB3, wired to the Arduino
  * Code on the Arduino read the i/o and participate as a node in ROS
  * Publishing information
* ROS info required
  * What is the "topic" that the device publishes to
  * How frequently does it publish (e.g. 10 times per second, once every second)
  * And what is the message type
* Acting on the sensor data
  * A node subscribes to that topic
  * Writes a "handler" which is invoked each time the sensor node publishes
* Simulation and IRL are different
  * Sensor's specifications are different (subtly)
  * Ranges and what happens when out of range
  * Degree of "randomness"
  * Exact dimensions of robots, obstacles, etc.

### Example - Simple "Roomba" pattern

Roomba is iRobot's robotic vacuum cleaner. It seems to just drive forward until it gets to a wall and then turn some amount and then continue. We want to think through a simplistic version of this pattern.

### Design
* Loop forever
    * While there a wall ahead
        * Rotate in place
    * Move forward until there's a wall ahead 

##### Discussion about this approach
* What questions need to be answered?
* Will it work?

##### Lets look at some code that uses sensors
* `prrexamples/pid_driver4.py`
* `prrexamples/pid_range.py`

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
