## Logistics

* Vibe check

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Steering and navigation

* Focusing for now on autonomous, ground based mobile robots. 
* Software needs to be able to command the robot
* Given wheels with motors, or tracks, or casters, or legs
* Electricity controlled through software makes them move
* So consider this...

<slide_break></slide_break>

## What is needed in terms of data + algorithms to
  1. Steer from Shapiro to Usdan
  2. Steer from Waltham to Boston
  3. Stay in a lane
  4. Drive in a straight road
  5. Turn a corner
  6. Make a 90 degree turn
  7. Simply drive in a straight line
  8. Move at x Meters/second
  9. Turn at 10 degrees/second

<hr/>

* Break into break out rooms by team
* Use this [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1qq1H52BSNmU1744ittKyGUjwiLyi8kKuJIJt2sP02iM/edit?usp=sharing) to make notes during your breakout.
* Indicate which one you're answering that have not been answered yet.

## Steering for wheeled vehicles

* Degrees of freedom for different things
  1. Train? 
  1. Baseball?
  1. Drone?
  1. Car?
  1. Tank?
* Holonomic vs. Non-
  1. Holonomic means able to move in all possible dimensions
  1. Non-holonomic means that it cannot do this

## Types Mobile Robots
* Motors drive Wheels
* Differential Drive
* Tri-cycle vehicle
* [Ackermann Steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry)
* Articulated Vehicle
* Legged

### Different Configurations for wheeled

* "Differential drive"
  * Steering is achieved by driving wheels at different speeds
  * Geometry calculations to determine what delta rpm leads to what kind of turn
  * Usually three wheels, two with motors, one "caster"
* Tri-cycle steering
  * Two fixed Wheels
  * A third wheel with a steerable mount
* Ackerman Steering
  * Where the steering is achieved by actual rotation of the wheel mount
  * Note subtle difference from parallel steering
* Four wheel drive
* Articulated Vehicle
  * Where the vehicle itself has a pivot point
  * Notice that to steer the vehicle an algorithm needs to convert the desired rotation to proportional wheel spinning

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Firmware

* Software and hardware architecture
* cmd_vel: needs to convert from high level units to motor commands
* odom: needs to convert from sensors (motor decoder and others) into coordinates
* Big deal is being aware of known errors from the manufacturer
* We wont go into the detailed geometry and math but it is very well studied and understood

## Other scenarios
* Legged Vehicles
* Tracked vehicles (tanks)
* Water surface vehicles
* Under water vehicles
* Aerial vehicles

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Terrain

* Indoor vs. outdoor
  * Traction and slippage
  * Weather effects - wet, dry, light, dark
* Inclines and declines
  * Needs more force
  * Also affects levelness
  * Direction that cameras and sensors are pointed 

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Sensors
* The role of sensors in controlling motion
* Self-sensors (like odometry)
* External sensors (like LIDAR)
* Our Robotis TB3 Burger uses [HLS-LFCD2](https://dabit.industries/products/360-laser-distance-sensor-lds-01-lidar)
* Review of dead reckoning
* Review of "real robots don't drive straight"
