## Logistics

* Vibe check
* Experiment using Jam Boards - have you?

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Steering and navigation

* Focusing for now on autonomous, ground based mobile robots. 
* Software needs to be able to command the robot
* Given wheels with motors, or tracks, or casters, or legs
* Electricity controlled through software makes them move
* So consider this...

<slide_break></slide_break>

## What is needed in terms of data + algorithms to
  1. Drive in a straight road
  1. Turn a corner
  1. Make a 90 degree turn
  1. Stay in a lane
  1. Steer from Shapiro to Usdan
  1. Move at x Meters/second
  1. Turn at 10 degrees/second

## Steering for wheeled vehicles

* Degrees of freedom for different things
  1. Train? 
  1. Baseball?
  1. Drone?
  1. Car?
  1. Tank?

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Holonomic vs. Non-Holonomic
* Actual vs. Controllable degrees of freedom
* If they are the same, then Holonomic
* If they are different, then non-Holonomic

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Holonomic vs. Non-Holonomic

* Car
  1. Will never leave the ground
  1. So it's actual DoF  is 3 (move forward and sideways, and yaw)
  1. But its controllable DoF is 2 (wheel rotation and steering)
* Differential Drive
  1. Actual DoF is 3 also
  1. Controllable DoF is 1 (wheel rotation)

### Different Configurations for wheeled

* "Differential drive"
  * Steering is achieved by driving wheels at different speeds
  * Geometry calculations to determine what delta rpm leads to what kind of turn
  * Usually three wheels, two with motors, one "caster"
* Tri-cycle steering
  * Two fixed Wheels
  * A third wheel with a steerable mount
* [Ackermann Steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry)
  * Where the steering is achieved by actual rotation of the wheel mount
  * Note subtle difference from parallel steering
* Four wheel drive
* Articulated Vehicle
  * Where the vehicle itself has a pivot point
  * Notice that to steer the vehicle an algorithm needs to convert the desired rotation to proportional wheel spinning

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Firmware

* Software and hardware architecture
* cmd_vel: needs to convert from high level units to motor commands
* odom: needs to convert from sensors (motor decoder and others) into coordinates
* Big deal is being aware of known errors from the manufacturer
* We wont go into the detailed geometry and math but it is very well studied and understood

## Other scenarios
* Legged Vehicles
* Tracked vehicles (tanks)
* Water surface vehicles
* Under water vehicles
* Aerial vehicles

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Terrain

* Indoor vs. outdoor
  * Traction and slippage
  * Weather effects - wet, dry, light, dark
  * Visibility of Sky
* Inclines and declines and surface
  * Needs more force
  * Also affects levelness
  * Direction that cameras and sensors are pointed 

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Sensors
* The role of sensors in controlling motion
* Self-sensors (like odometry)
* External sensors (like LIDAR)
* TB3 Burger uses [HLS-LFCD2](https://dabit.industries/products/360-laser-distance-sensor-lds-01-lidar)
* MiniRover uses [YDlidar X4](https://www.ydlidar.com/Public/upload/files/2020-04-13/YDLIDAR%20X4%20Datasheet.pdf)
* Review of dead reckoning
* Review of "real robots don't drive straight"
