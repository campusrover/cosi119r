:h3 How Projects Will Work

* Final projects will be 35% of your grade
* You may choose to work alone or on a team with 2 other students (3 total max)
* You will be able to form your own teams
* :topic_link :cosi119a_final_project

:slide_title Review - how it works in ROS (5 minutes)

* All your code (almost) in ROS is a node
* All information (almost) is transferred in the form of messages

:slide_title Sensors

* Are electronic devices
* Wired to the built in computer
* In the case of the TB3, wired to the Arduino
* Code on the Arduino read the i/o and participate as a node in ROS
* Publishing information

:slide_title ROS info required

* What is the "topic" that the device publishes to
* How frequently does it publish (e.g. 10 times per second, once every second)
* And what is the message type

:slide_title Acting on the sensor data
* A node subscribes to that topic
* Writes a "handler" which is invoked each time the sensor node publishes

:slide_title Simulation and IRL are different

* Sensor's specifications are different (subtly)
* Ranges and what happens when out of range
* Degree of "randomness"
* Exact dimensions of robots, obstacles, etc.

:slide_title Lets look at some code about sensors

* Demonstrate code from [RPSExamples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campusrover/rpsexamples/main/src/outbackstraight2.py?token=AAAK5CK2M32BIJ4SOJKU6EDAH6CK6)
* Demonstrate Laser data quality by [looking at it in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FmGs7XlWe9YGtRFutOiiqSNj7i2DxvQIfJmmn1yMBvw/edit?usp=sharing)
