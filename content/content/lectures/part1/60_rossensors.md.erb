:slide_title Review - how it works in ROS (5 minutes)

* All your code (almost) in ROS is a node
* All information (almost) is transferred in the form of messages

:slide_title Sensors

* Are electronic devices
* Connected to the Robot's computer
* Generatel data very fast
* They require real-time processing
* Publishing information

:slide_title What kinds of sensors?
* LIDAR: Rapidly rotates a laser, returns distance to nearest obstacle on each bearing
* Camera: Measures color and brightness of light in a 2D grid
* IMU: Measures accelration in 6 DOF. Sometimes also measures magnetic north
* Odometry: Measures position of wheels as they rotate
* GPS: Uses satelites to measure position on the earth

:slide_title All Sensor Data is Noisy

* The data you get from them is generally large arrays of floating point numbers
* Even if nothing is changing, you will see it change a lot
* Signal vs. Noise
* There are many techniques for extracting the signatl

:slide_title Sensor Data delivered as ROS topics

* What is the "topic" that the device publishes to
* How frequently does it publish (e.g. 10 times per second, once every second)
* And what is the message type
* Often 10 to 60 times per second. Real Time

:slide_title Acting on the sensor data

* A node subscribes to that topic
* Writes a "handler" which is invoked each time the sensor node publishes

:slide_title Simulation and IRL are different

* Sensor's specifications are different (subtly)
* Ranges and what happens when out of range
* Degree of "randomness"
* Exact dimensions of robots, obstacles, etc.
