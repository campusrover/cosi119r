:h2 Logistics

* Secret attendance code is: 
* Discuss what makes a good project and how many people is appropriate
* Take a look at [ROS Robotics Projects](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/hardware-and-creative/9781783554713) for ideas.

:slide_title Coordinate systems

* Where is a robot? How do we designate the location?
* If it's a surface moving mobile robot, then an x,y coordinate would seem to be sufficient
* We need to determine the units: for us, usually Meters
* We need to designate the origin
* Anything else?

:slide_title What about the "real world"?

* Where is that 0,0?
* Does it matter?

:slide_title What part of the robot?

* What part of the robot are we talking about?
* The "middle"?
* Who says where the middle is?
* Does it matter how high of the ground it is?

:slide_title Orientation

* What about where it is pointing?
* Is that part of the orientation?
* What does it mean to tell the robot to rotate right or left?
* Is that direction also part of the orientation in space?
* When would that matter?

:slide_title Demo

:slide_title What else?

* What other aspects of orientation in space?
* If the Robot has a camera mounted on it?
* If there is an arm?
* Robot pushing an elevator button

:slide_title Actions

* Taking action based on orientation. Think about:
* Turn Right
* Turn North
* Point camera in the direction of the sound

:slide_title  "Pose"

* The combination of the robot's position and orientation (direction it is pointing)
* Each one has 3 dimensions: x,y,z and r,p,y
* x,y,z are cartesian coordinates
* r,p,y are Euler coordinates

:slide_title Multiple Coordinate systems

* Each component of the robot potentially has a coordinate system
* Many of them have a fixed relationship to each other
* Point 0,0 for the robot's tf might be Point 10,0 for the camera's tf
* There are coordinate systems attached to (each) robot
* But also to the rest of the "world" the robot knows about

:slide_title Conversions

* Converting between coordinate systems
* Very common calculation is to convert a certain actual point
* From one coordinate system to another

:slide_title ROS Units and data types

* In ROS, we use the following units:
  1. Distance: Meter
  2. Velocity: Meters/Second
  3. Angles: Radians (sometimes degrees)
  4. Orientation: Euler angles (roll pitch yaw) or Quaternions

:slide_title Euler Angles

* Conventional way to represent orientation
* Pitch, Roll, Yaw (from airplanes)
* Can be radians or angles, but for ROS poses, it's radians
* Reminder: Radians go from 0 (0 degrees) to 2 * PI (360 degrees == 0 degrees)

:slide_title  Quaternions

* Quaternion represents the same, but with 4 numbers
* There's an exact conversion between Euler angles and Quaternions
* For subtle mathematical reasons, when combining a series of rotations, Quaternions work better
* Don't try to interpret the x,y,z,r of a quaternion, it doesn't have an intuitive mapping to x,y and z euler angles.

:h2 Datatypes in ROS

* ROS "messages", also *.msg files
* Really amount to a C `struct`

:slide_title Point

* Point (geometry_msgs/Point.msg)
* x,y,z: float64
* A point in 3D space
* Right hand rule
* positive x-forward, positive y-left, positive z-up

:slide_title Vector3

* Vector3 (geometry_msgs/Vector3.msg)
* x, y, z: float64
* Simple, generic representation of 3 float64

:slide_title Quaternion

* Orientation (geometry_msgs/Quaternion.msg)
* x, y, z, w: float64
* An orientation in space, in quaternion form
* Quaternions are another way to express orientation

:slide_title Pose

* Pose (geometry_msgs/Pose.msg)
* position: Point
* orientation: Quaternion
* A combination of "where" and "facing what way"

:slide_title Twist

* Velocity in free space, broken into linear and angular
* Twist (geometry_msgs/Twist.msg)
* linear, angular: Vector3
