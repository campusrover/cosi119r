1. <%= zipbadge %> Do <%= link_to_topic :hw_tf2 %>. Follow the instructions and submit the requested deliverables.


#### Your feedback t me

##### Hard because of Time Constraints
* More papers to read
* More demonstrations of "new" things, e.g. sensors, arm, etc
* Show how to use other packages, e.g. pid

##### Will try to do
* Let us form teams ourselves
* More code walkthrough and explanations of code
* Review code after submission so that we can learn and improve (2x)
* More troubleshooting instructions
* More relaxed in lecture
* More diverse students
* Strategies to solve problems in addition to examples.

##### Need discussion
* Clearer grading and rubrics - whats the difference between a 97 and 100? (2x)
* More robot specific examples of actions and services early on
* Less frequent, and harder assignments, slower pace for larger deliverables (2x)
* More guided labs (there seem to be people falling behind)
* More experimental, less theoretical
* In class tutorials of all mathematical concepts

#### Lab today
* What (if any) guided lab topic?

#### Localization

##### What exactly is the problem with knowing where you are?

* Remember all of this needs an agreed upon coordinate system!
* How would you do it with your eyes closed?
* Recall `odometry` is like `dead reckoning`
* Lots of noise in the signal; accuracy varies; errors build up

##### What kinds of landmarks can be used?
* Lidar detected fixed obstacles
* Vision detected fixed obstacles
* How can one obstacle be distinguished from another?

##### Lidar detection
* Robot has a 'map' of fixed obstacles
* Robot compares that map with the apparent, transient, map from Lidar
* Calculates a probability distribution of where it might be on that map
* Process is called AMCL

##### Visual Detection
* Robot has a collection of scenes it can recognize.
* Some requirements:
  * CV (computer vision) algorithms need to be able to identify and differentiate it from other images
  * A coordinate in 3D space is required
  * It needs to stay put and not move
  * Examples: facade of a building, a particular tree, a wall, etc.
  * Bad examples: a parked car; a person
* With each scene is the coordinates that correspond to the recognized scene
* CV is constantly analyzing what is seen by the camera
* As soon as it identifies an image, it can use that to figure out where it is
* Note! It has to also figure out where IT is relative to the image

##### AMCL
* Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization
* Very sophisticated (and standard) mathematical technique
* Can be used with different kinds of sensors.
* Example here is LIDAR.
  * Requires a map of Lidar visible obstacles, with a coordinate system, and anchored in the real world
  * Given a stationary robot, and a lidar scan, what does it see?
  * Look for a match on the map
  * Form a probability distribution of where the robot MIGHT be
  * Move the robot a little.
  * Compute what the lidar would see given what is known about the motion
  * Update the probabilities

##### SLAM
* What if there is no map yet?
* Simultaneous localization and mapping
* Create a theoretical map based on view of the LIDAR
* Move the robot a little and update the map
* Travel through the relevant region (using e.g. Teleop)
* Use the map to localize, or where there is no map yet, extend the map.

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
