* Checkin Questions
* Standups

:slide_bigtitle Robot Behavior - Big Idea

:topic_include :complexprobs

:slide_title What do we mean by Complex Behavior?

* Obey a high level goal by creating subgoals, and responding to real time events
* `move_base` behaviors are pretty complex
* A lot can be learned from Computer Games and the behavior of "Non Player Characters"
* Obviously an open ended question with many different approaches

:discussion_box "Which teams have an example of requiring "complex behavior", or of apparent 'inteligence'. What were you planning to do?"

:slide_title Example scenario

* Lets say we want to implement the following "complex behavior":

:callout :small, "behavior", " If the robot is stuck, then try the following, one after the other until the robot is unstuck: a) Conservative reset; b) clearing rotation; c) aggressive reset; d) clearing rotation. If after all of those the robot is still stuck, then abort the navigation."

:discussion_box "How would you imlement that?"

:slide_title Introduction to Finite State Machines

* Basic and very useful way to control behaviors
* And with lots of other applications! (See Regular Expressions and Cosi 130A)
* You have seen it before, whether you identified it as an FSM or not`
* Essential features:
  1. Named nodes, corresponding to states
  1. Edges connecting nodes, corresponding to "inputs"
  1. Initial, Final and current states
* Algorithm
  1. Start in the initial state
  1. Receive an input
  1. Follow the one edge out of that state, given that input
  1. Repeat until you get to final state
* Notice that depending on the scenario, the states, transitions and inputs can be very different.

:slide_title Example of a real world FSM used in ROS

:slide_title Implementations

* So simple that you don't really need a package 
* But one part of the diagram can't be implemented as a basic FSM
* We can either modify it or use a more fancy kind of finite state machine

:discussion_box "Can you tell what the error is in the diagram (I didn't notice it before I actually went to implement it)"

:slide_title Using `transitions` python package

* You can decide whether you want to use a package or not
* My favorite package is: [pytransitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions)
* And [implementation of the above FSM with pytransitions](https://github.com/campusrover/prrexamples/blob/master/src/fsm_example.py)

:discussion_box "What are the tradeoffs in using a package or not?"

:slide_title Introduction to Behavior Trees

* Some similarity to FSM, however...
* BTs are specifically trees, with one root and leaves
* BTs have different `kinds` of nodes with very different semantics
* The `leaves` represent the actual control actions
* All the other nodes are part of the control logic
