# 2020

## My takeaway

* Review the first 3 PAs. We start too slow
* Add lectures on Behavior Trees and Computer Vision
* Create final project groups at the start and use them in assignments
* Slack is very useful
* Make sure all assignments have the "stretch goals" section
* Get the projects going more quickly (not sooner, just compress the startup phases)

### Done
* Reconsider how to use the MiniRovers
* Keep the check-in quizzes

## "What is the course about"

* a hands-on, project based, intro to robotics class
* python
* Fun and interactive
* Challenging but in the best way possible, and ultimately rewarding
* Really fun place to actually learn about autonomous robotics and you come away feeling like you know something, won't be the class that will kill you workwise.
* It is interesting to learn! lots of engineering involved!
* A course that you can be creative with and apply yourself
* Very practical and good introduction to robotics.
* Lots of hands-on, practical programming experience for robotics, you'll have something to show for the class at the end (final project).
* Ran code. Works. Ran same code. Works. Ran same code. Works. Ran same code. Broken.
interesting, informative and collaborative
* Pito's course!
& How about a two for one: 1. tfw you are searching on answers.ros.org and see the same question you have, asked by your professor (spiderman pointing meme) 2. robot: *starts moving correctly after launching code for the 20th time* me: *hits record button on OBS furiously* yep this one's going in my youtube compilation!

## "What was your biggest learning"

* ROS, PID, computer vision
* tf trees and gazebo topics/services/subscribers & PYTHON!
* I would say the computer vision is really interesting
* Tfs are way more important than I ever thought they were, and if theres one thing I shouldnt forget, its this
* Robotics is really fun, this is how a virtual class should be taught, other professors should take note.
* Learning the fundamentals of robotics
* Using ROS
* Robots are cool
* The ROS environment in general, practical experience mapping sensor inputs to meaningful actions in the world at the level of an algorithm (I think about this a lot in the realm of AI and also philosophy and human psychology)
* Groups of even just two people make a problem that sounds impossible to solve solvable.
* My biggest learnings are lidar, odom and computer vision are great tools to use, googling and asking on stack overflow is important for cs, and how to use gazebo (making a world, etc)
* how to build a Robotics System
* How to complete a project and time management, more hands-on git experience, ROS, learning how to learn, and having lots and lots of patience with Gazebo and ROS :)

## Raw Feedback

* More different types of robot control, ie. car steering, 4 wheel drive robot, robotics arm... even in simulation

* I would personally want to consolidate final projects as early as we can so we can start tackling it with as much time as possible. These projects can be very complex and groups like to set ambitious goals, but not all of these goals can be met once the project starts so its good to get a hefty head start so people can determine what need to be done and what needs to be thrown out.

* The course itself is very thought provoking and fun. Every time I was learning for a project, it would feel like a DIY project. Maybe more computer vision in the future.

* I think this course was incredibly educational and fun. This was one of my favorite courses I've ever taken, and I learned a lot about robotics. I really like that we learned how to make robots autonomous and able to do things on their own so we don't have to control them, as well as learning about computer vision, which is used in many places, not just robotics. I would recommend, as said in class, changing when the final project groups are assigned so we have more time to figure it out and work, but other than that, its a great class!

* Easily the most successful course I have taken virtually by far. Beginning was kind of slow, replacement of exams with thoughtful PAs was much better. Final project is awesome, could have gotten started a bit quicker. All the speakers were amazing. Course load was middle of the road. The Slack and availability of everyone was hugely important. If we could incorporate more engineering somehow that would be really fun but also I just want to build robots so I might be in the minority there. Very rewarding, one of the best courses, felt like I actually learned something useful, I want to go work on robotics now.

* The class overall is great! I do not know exactly what to say as for improvements since the class is done remotely and I wonder how it is differed from in person robotics class. As for virtual class env: One suggestion would be keeping cloud env more robust. Many of us has encountered the cloud desktop problem during the semester and it can be very frustrating at times.  The programming assignment is a little less intense than I expected. Some of the added feature (on top of the basic functionality everyone has to implement to get the base grade) can be easily done. It would be better if there are more challenging work!

* I liked the freedom students had to do projects in their own way and pursue what we were interested in. I honestly liked the pace of the course, maybe the second PA was a little too easy but I feel the first two PAs were necessary for us to learn the bare bones basics of ROS and I feel like that was accomplished.

* Speeding up the start of the course and maybe weight assignments contribution to the final grade.  In terms of extra things to do in an assignment, I think on the more open-ended assignments (race track) giving them a bigger part of the final score would give more incentive to try.

* The first two PAs could be more challenging, more time for the final projects would be good. I like the practical project-based nature of this course, I feel I learn a lot more that way and have something tangible to show for the class afterward. Was good to have final project and no final exam!

* I definitely improved my problem solving abilities in this course. Robotics is different than any other elective I've taken because you might write code and think it theoretically works perfectly, but when you run the robot, there are small issues that amount to an unperfected result. This aspect of physical programming was very interesting and important, yet very frustrating at the same time after being trained in so many ultimately hypothetical computer science courses. It was very rewarding to learn that even if you think your solution works, and it works virtually, there are some issues that you will find only when it runs physically.

* I think being a virtual class, it was really well done. I learnt a lot about ros and the simulation was really convenient. I also liked the collaboration aspect of it and the discussions and the TA's and your teaching was great. One feedback I have is that I had bought a robot and I liked the in person meet ups because they helped me learn more about how to work with a real robot so I think it would have been nice if there were more meetings specifically with the people with robots for tips/non graded assignments (these meetings can even be virtual) so that we could make more use of the robot because i found myself just using the simulation for the PA's because I knew it better and for example, line follower, I didn't know how to do that in real life in terms of identifying the colors and things like that. I think these meetings would have made me to use the real robot more.

* its is rewarding. I learned how to use the gmapping to build map, how to navigate etc. all these help me to understand how a real world sweeping robot works and how to solve the real world problems using those knowledge

* Content-- The content was interesting and the structure of the class helped me feel like I will retain a lot of information from the course applicable to other areas. As others have said the first few weeks started out rather slowly, and reducing the time to cover the info in the first 2 weeks' lectures into 1 week might help squeeze more content into the semester? In addition, some of the time feels inefficiently spent by doing/reviewing quizzes every lecture and it could be reduced (perhaps by making quizzes asynchronous, or for people to take near the end of the lecture, or just adding a stricter time limit). The quizzes themselves are very helpful though and shouldn't be left out. More group work during lectures (like writing a bit of code, proposing solutions to problems, everybody working on the live demos) could make lectures more interesting and engaging.  Term project organization-- Along with what others have said I agree that it would have been better to start the organization of teams and ideas better to save more time for the actual work on the project. What I really appreciated was the presentations every Tuesday though! Even though they are a bit stressful, it's very interesting to see what everybody has done and having a weekly schedule to adhere to was so important for advancing on the project as it's so easy to put final projects off in other courses until the week before it's due, thank you for doing that. Definitely please keep the term project in place of a final exam!  Reading-- Reading was the hardest part for me to do, especially the papers. Although I still learnt from reading and understand that some stuff can only be squeezed in by having us read the book/papers, it was better to retain information by doing the PAs/watch the lectures.  Time needed-- Time needed was pretty consistent for the course. The first 3 PAs took very little time but the wall follow PA and Race track PA took considerably longer for me than any other PA (due to juggling other courses at the time it would have been nice to have more time on those PAs specifically).  Etc-- It would be nice if grades could be delivered sooner or some other way that helps students feel less worried about grades and more focused on the learning. I also wish we had more time to play around with robots IRL (understandable that it couldn't be helped, hopefully by next semester things are back to normal).
