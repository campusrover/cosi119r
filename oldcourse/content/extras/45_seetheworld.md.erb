#### Seeing == Vision
* We focus here on cameras
* Ignore other kinds of "seeing" such as touch sensors or LIDAR.

##### What kinds of cameras are available
* Regular (webcam-like) cameras
  * RGB images
  * Video is basically a stream of images
  * Usually it is treated just that way
  * Each image is analyzed individually
* Other bandwidth cameras
  * infrared, etc.
  * Not common
* Depth cameras
  * Mobile phone facial recognition
  * Microsoft Kinnect
  * In addition to R,G and B, each pixel has a number saying how far away that surface is

##### Considerations
* Resolution of image
* Power requirements
* Fixed direction or sometimes a swivel
* ROS needs to know how the cameras position and direction relates to the overall robot base
* Another job for TFs
* What would happen if this information is incorrect?
* Where do the images have to be "sent" to?

##### Connections
* USB or other Connections
* Image needs to be viewed through unix utility
* Which is not always easy
* Bandwidth and speed of connection

##### Computer Vision (CV)
* Recognizing: faces, locations, fiducials, gestures
* Image processing: filtering colors, isolating shapes etc.
* Machine Learning (ML): Statistical analyxsis of tagged images
