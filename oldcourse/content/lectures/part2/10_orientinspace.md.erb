1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read and Code** Read Chapters 9 **PLEASE** remember to refer to this (<%= link_to_topic :building_maps %> in parallel and use the code I provided!) <%= deliverable "Respond to the questions, and submit in a pdf" %> Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?

#### Discussion
* Next week's Maze homework is challenging. You will not be able to do it in one sitting. Start early!
* Next week's Maze homework is for teams of two students
    * Each student submits the same zip file
    * Each student privately submits a pdf report (1 page) explaining the design and architecture of your solutions, how it works, what parts each teammate did, and any other helpful information
* I have assigned the teams:
    * Dh Suh - Jesse Yang
    * Matthew Milendorf - Jacob Smith
    * Tirtho Aungon - Christopher Tan
    * Zekai Wang - Maxwell Hunslinger
    * Luis Andino - Benjamin Mallintyn
    * Addison Phita - Jade Garish
    * Zhidong Liu - Danbing Chen

* It's easy to keep this course organized, as long as everyone does their part
* Discuss new lab format
* Discuss extra lab
