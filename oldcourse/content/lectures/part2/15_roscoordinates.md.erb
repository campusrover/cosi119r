## Logistics


* "Post-it Note" exercise
* List on the board the projects and teams that are in Discussion
* Discuss what makes a good project and how many people is appropriate
* Take a look at [ROS Robotics Projects](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/hardware-and-creative/9781783554713) for ideas. 
* Lets look at <%= link_to_section :lab, :project_list %>

#### Coordinate Systems:

* Coordinate systems
  * Where is a robot? How do we designate the location?
  * If it's a surface moving mobile robot, then an x,y coordinate would seem to be sufficient
  * We need to determine the units: for us, usually Meters
  * We need to designate the origin
  * Anything else?

* What about the "real world"?
  * Where is that 0,0?
  * Does it matter?

* What part of the robot are we talking about?
  * The "middle"?
  * Who says where the middle is?
  * Does it matter how high of the ground it is?

* What about where it is pointing?
  * Is that part of the orientation?
  * What does it mean to tell the robot to rotate right or left?
  * Is that direction also part of the orientation in space?
  * When would that matter?

* What other aspects of orientation in space?
  * If the Robot has a camera mounted on it?
  * If there is an arm?
  * Robot pushing an elevator button

* Taking action based on orientation. Think about:
  * Turn Right
  * Turn North
  * Point camera in the direction of the sound

* "Pose"
  * The combination of the robot's position and orientation (direction it is pointing)
  * Each one has 3 dimensions: x,y,z and r,p,y
  * x,y,z are cartesian coordinates
  * r,p,y are Euler coordinates

* Multiple Coordinate systems
  * Each component of the robot potentially has a coordinate system
  * Many of them have a fixed relationship to each other
  * Point 0,0 for the robot's tf might be Point 10,0 for the camera's tf
  * There are coordinate systems attached to (each) robot
  * But also to the rest of the "world" the robot knows about

* Converting between coordinate systems
  * Very common calculation is to convert a certain actual point
  * From one coordinate system to another
#### ROS Units and data types

##### Units in ROS
* In ROS, we use the following units:
   * Distance: Meter
   * Velocity: Meters/Second
   * Angles: Radians (sometimes degrees)
   * Orientation: Euler angles (roll pitch yaw) or Quaterions

* Euler Angles and Quaterions
   * Conventional way to represent orientation
   * Pitch, Roll, Yaw (from airplanes)
   * Can be radians or angles, but for ROS poses, it's radians
   * Reminder: Radians go from 0 (0 degrees) to 2 * PI (360 degrees == 0 degrees)ss
   * Quaternion represents the same, but with 4 numbers
   * There's an exact conversion between Euler angles and Quaterions
   * For subtle mathematical reasons, when combining a series of rotations, Quaterions work better
   * Don't try to interpret the x,y,z,r of a quaternion, it doesn't have an intuitive mapping to x,y and z euler angles.
   
* Points
   * x, y, z as float64 (double)
   * Right Hand Rule
   * positive x-forward, positive y-left, positive z-up
 
##### Datatypes in ROS

* ROS "messages", also *.msg files
* Really amount to a C `struct`

* Point (geometry_msgs/Point.msg)
   * x,y,z: float64
   * A point in 3D space
 
 * Vector3 (geometry_msgs/Vector3.msg)
   * x, y, z: float64
   * Simple, generic representation of 3 float64

 * Orientation (geometry_msgs/Quaternion.msg)
   * x, y, z, w: float64
   * An orientation in space, in quaternion form
   * Quaterions are another way to express orientation

 * Pose (geometry_msgs/Pose.msg)
   * position: Point
   * orientation: Quaternion
   * A combination of "where" and "facing what way"

* Twist (geometry_msgs/Twist.msg)
   * linear, angular: Vector3
   * Velocity in free space, broken into linear and angular
 
#### Next Class
