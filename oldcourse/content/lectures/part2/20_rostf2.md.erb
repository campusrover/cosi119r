<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Read and actually code up  the examples in the [TF2 Tutorials Sequence](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials). There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:
    1. What is the TF tree? Where is it stored? (that may be a trick question!)
    1. In your own words, how does turtle_tf2_demo work?
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.
    <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>

#### Review
* An x,y,z is always within a specific coordinate system
* For example, is it relative to the bottom left corner of the room, or the center of the robot?
* It is far easier to reason in an appropriate coordinate system
* As long as there are easy ways to convert back and forth.
* Pose = position and orientation
* Pose is always with respect of a specific coordinate frame or TF
* Usually a coordinate begins as the "natural" way to think about It
  * Angle of obstacle, with respect to the LIDAR
  * Position a corner, with respect to the whole room
  * Angle to turn, from the point of view of the robot itself
  * So when you see phrases like "with respect to", and "from the point of view of" you know these refer to coordinate frames.
* It is very common to want to see that same point or angle from another's point of view
  * How bit a turn to I need to point directly away from the wall?
  * What direction is the nearest door from me?
* Compare starboard/port and driver vs. passenger side

#### TF
* TF package in ROS is central
* It recently was rewritten and shows up as TF2 in many places
* It is interesting and important to understand in some more detail

##### TF framework in ROS
* An API to make conversions of coordinates between systems easy and efficient
* Coordinate systems are given names, e.g. "world" or "lidar-1"
* They are organized into a tree
* Every named tf has just one parent, and unlimited number of children
* TF broadcasts
   * Any node can report on the relationship between two coordinate system
   * Generally this is a node who knows something about one or the other.
   * For example, the node that moved the arm, can report the new relative position
   * That is, to get from tf "a" to tf "b", add add 10 to the x or rotate 180 degrees around z.
* TF Listeners
   * If my node needs to interpret coordinates I might listen to tf messages
   * Allowing to convert coordinates between any two coordinate frames.

##### Lets look at some code
* If you want to follow along, we are going to look at [Introduction to tf2](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf2)
<%= code_begin %>
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-turtle-tf2 ros-melodic-tf2-tools ros-melodic-tf
$ roslaunch turtle_tf2 turtle_tf2_demo.launch
<%= code_end %>
* Notice that as you use the cursor keys to teleop the orange turtle around, the grey one follows right on it's heels!

##### High Level explanation
* Code is using tf2 to create three coordinate frames: one for the "world", and one each for the two turtles
* Realize that if we give turtle1's coordinates as x,y, we'd still need to say, in what coordinate frame those were.
* In t1's coordinate frame, t1's coordinates are always 0,0!
* Lets take a look!
<%= code_begin %>
$ rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
$ evince frames.pdf
<%= code_end %>
* See the three coordinate frames and their hierarchical relationship
* The diagram doesn't display the actual transform just the relationships
* To see those we need to echo the transform:
<%= code_begin %>
$ rosrun tf tf_echo turtle1 turtle2
$ rosrun tf tf_echo turtle1 world
<%= code_end %>

<%= discussion_box "You can see the transform needed to get from turtle1 to turtle2 is different from the one betweek turtle1 and world. Why is that?" %>

##### Visualization

<%= code_begin %>
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtle_tf2`/rviz/turtle_rviz.rviz
<%= code_end %>

<%= discussion_box "You now visualize all three tfs. Why do two move and one stay still? " %>

#####  Lets see how all this works: tf2_broadcaster

* Examine the code in prrexamples: `tf2_demo.launch` and `turtle_tf2_broadcaster.py`

<%= code_begin %>
$ roslaunch learning_tf2 start_demo.launch
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle1
<%= code_end %>

* Only one turtle so far!
* Notice that it is publishing turtle1's `tf`s relative to world
* Drive around and notice that it is updating turtle1's pose and also a transform

#####  Lets see how all this works: tf2_listener

* Examine the code in prrexamples: `tf2_demo.launch` and `turtle_tf2_listener.py`
<%- code_begin %>
$ roslaunch learning_tf2 start_demo.launch
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle1
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle2
<%= code_end %>

##### tf2 frames are organized in a tree

<%= code_begin %>
$ rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
$ evince frames.pdf
<%= code_end %>
* No cycles, one root
* This ensures that there's only one path from one frame to another
* Which ensure that we can compute the transform by following that path
* New frame would be added as a child of an existing frame
* How to decide what the parent frame should be?
* Its the one that has the most obvious and simple transform
