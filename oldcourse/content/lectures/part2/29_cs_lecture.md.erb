<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Read and Do** Read PRR Chapter 10. **PLEASE** remember to refer to this (<%= link_to_topic :localization %> in parallel and use the code I provided!). There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:
    1. Why is it important to get a good initial localization? Why is that needed at all? Could AMCL work without it?
    1. This one is a little tricky. When I am using AMCL and move_base, can I use teleop to cause the robot to crash into the wall. Give your reasoning! You might  need to try this to get a good answer. It will be a very interesting experiment.
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.
    <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>
