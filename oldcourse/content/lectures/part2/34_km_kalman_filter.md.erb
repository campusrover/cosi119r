1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> Read [How a Kalman Filter Works in Pictures]( https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/). Respond to the following warmup questions:
    * Would you guess that a covariance matrix is symmetric? What's your reasoning?
    * In the example with the robot in the forest there's an (inaccurate) GPS and an (inaccurate) prediction of travel. How good an estimate of position would you get if the robot didn't move at all? <%= deliverable "Your answer to these questions in a pdf."%>
